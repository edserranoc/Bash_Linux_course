This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement.",8/31/15,NEUTRAL

About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.",8/31/15,POSITIVE

Long Review/ Story.,"Where do I begin? I received my brand new lil washer machine today. Couldn‚Äôt be more excited to do laundry! After 12 years of schlepping to the laundry mat, dodging cars to cross the street, counting pennies to convert to quarters,  I finally invested in my own private washing machine. I have to admit, this is my 3rd attempt at buying a portable washing machine in the last month. One of the main reasons why I made a decision to make this type of purchase is that the laundry-mat disgusts me. After 10+ years of going to the Ol coin op, I finally had it. I did a load of wash, and when it was done, I took my clothes out and everything was covered in Dog/ Cat hair. EVERYTHING was covered. IM highly allergic to dogs and cats and thankfully the laundry manager was there when this happened. She gave me quarters to re-wash my clothes. Unfortunately, the second wash didn‚Äôt get all the hairs out, so after drying, I took a lint brush to every article of clothing, to try and get what pet hair was left. It was a complete nightmare! And so from that, I went on Amazon, read a million and 1 reviews and bought the Wonder Washer.  WHAT a JOKE! Then I made a second purchase for the E-clean‚Ä¶ NOT fun either. SO, after more research and more re-reading of all those millions of reviews on every single portable washer unit on Amazon, I made the brave decision, took a leap of faith, and got The Laundry Alternative Super Compact 5.5 lb capacity. Ill be honest, I was really trying to save money with the other 2 previous purchases, but what I got was a huge headache, ruined clothes, broken machines, time lost, lint monsters, and sprained wrist from wringing clothes (not really, but you get my drift). In the long run, many months from now, maybe even years, that this Laundry Alternative Super Compact will eventually pay for itself.  So my review, to be fair was going to be a 1 star, maybe 2 stars. The machine I received came poorly packaged and the unit had a crack on the inside motor area. It still leaks from the body, but that‚Äôs due to it being cracked and from it being poorly made/ assembled. Here‚Äôs is a brief rundown of my first impressions: -Received item in a non-secured box. The bottom of the box was taped on, and was not part of the box. -When opened, broken pieces of foam came out of the box and were all broken inside the washer where the motor and wires are. I carefully vacuumed the inside to gather as much of the broken pieces of foam. -I thoroughly inspected the unit, and found 1 major crack on the motor cover, and the front of the unit being unevenly put together. -The exterior outside unit was dirty, with dirt marks around it. -When lifted and carried to kitchen to hook it up, there were swishing sounds of water. -Major water leaks from base and side exterior. No water leaks from hose/ faucet hookup. -A random black plastic block fell from the inside. I have no idea what‚Äôs it for. It had grease on it.  AND here is my simple comparison bullets: Laundry Mat: Pros: -Get multiple loads of wash done  Cons: -Dollars and Quarters‚Ä¶. -Other people‚Äôs clothes you don‚Äôt know being washed in that very same washer you just washed your clothes in. Do you really think your clothes are being cleaned? -Time consuming -Cant really leave to tend to other errands, or do other things. You spend roughly 2+ hours at the laundry mat, not including fold time.  The Laundry Alternative: Pros: -Don‚Äôt have to go to laundry mat -NO more scrounging for quarters! -You can stay home and search Amazon for more cool apartment gadgets to buy to make your life easier. -Pretty quiet. -Once you get the hang of it, no babysitting! It‚Äôs all automatic and really does get your clothes clean -Pretty Compact and doesn‚Äôt take a lot of room. I have a very narrow small kitchen, so for me, IM going to need to store it someplace else. -It‚Äôs a wash, rinse, spin cycle! -NO SMELL! The WW and e-clean had this toxic smell to it, this didn‚Äôt. That was my fear, as I‚Äôm highly sensitive to chemical smells and IM very happy to report, no toxic smell (at least mine didn‚Äôt). -Fast Delivery, was delivered by USPS on a Sunday! Ordered on a Friday :)  Cons: -Very Flimsy gooseneck holder. Kept coming off the draining hose and wouldn‚Äôt stay put when water would drain. WATER went everywhere. I had to manually hold it in the sink every time the rinse cycle went. Eventually, after the 3rd wash, I took one side of the gooseneck holder and attached it to the black water hose (the one from faucet to laundry unit) and this kept the draining hose to stay in the sink (NO more babysitting ) -35 lbs is not too heavy, but not light enough (actually more annoying) to store and bring back to kitchen. Needs caster wheels that lock in place when using washer. -Only able to use cold water via the hose attachment. IM sure you could get a different hose that's suitable for any temperature, but that should have been done by the manufacture. -No gentle cycle -Pretty much everything is plastic made. The inside washing area is stainless steel. The agitator is plastic. -It will literally take you all day to do your laundry, as it‚Äôs very small and can only wash roughly 5.5lbs of clothes. So best used for daily, every other day light wash. (took me 5 hours to do 4 loads with clean up, hang drying, troubleshooting etc, those 4 loads would of been 1 load at the laundry mat) - The power cord is slightly too short. Needs about an extra 12 inches to it.  The initial leaking caused a major mini flood on my kitchen floors. The gooseneck hose holder is very flimsy and didn‚Äôt hold the hose properly onto the sink. When the rinse cycle started, the drain hose started doing the cobra dance and the drain water went all over everywhere. It was the first time for me to use this machine, so getting to know it was not friendly.  The washing portion of it was great. Very little to no lint left on the clothing after wash. Spin cycle does a great job, makes hang drying fasterand NO wringing of the clothes to get excess water! Even with the cracked motor and water leaking from the sides, I was able to wash 4 loads to test it out. With the first two loads, when the rinse cycle finished, dead small flies and foam particles came out. The second load, it was more just foam particles. The other two loads were to re-wash some of the towels I washed in the 1st & 2nd load, since the first load leaked and spewed water all over the floor that caused a mini flood. My kitchen rug was soaked, not only did I use towels, but went through an entire roll of paper towels. Water was everywhere. The only good thing that came out of that was my floor had an unexpected cleaning.  The good news is, that mini flood was not from the assembly of the actual unit, that flood was from the drain hose. After the 2nd wash, I was pretty familiar with how to navigate this bad boy, and by the 4th wash, I was sitting on my couch for 30 minutes while that load washed.  The unit still leaks water from the bottom (probably not safe because of the wiring and plug, and from the top/sides. IM not going to use the machine again, until I get a new one.  Overall, even with the broken machine, IM REALLY impressed with how well the machine handles clothes. IM impressed with the high quality faucet/hose attachment (I say this, because of the E-clean experience I had, you had to hold the cheaply made hose onto the sink while water filled the wash). No leaks from my sink faucet, no leaks to the washing unit (ALTHOUGH, when detaching water hose from washing unit, it will leak, so make sure you have a towel handy). I also love that the front right leg is an actual rotating wheel, which adjust to level with floor. It keeps the unit from shaking in spin cycle. -Once you understand and troubleshoot the trial and errors of the machine, you will not need to sit and babysit. The first 3 loads I did, water went everywhere, and I literally had a flood!  I do believe I need a new unit, one that issecurely packed carefully  and assembled properly so it doesn‚Äôt leak. I'll probably update this review once i get a new machine. My apologies, as this review has turned into a story. Right no",8/31/15,

I suspect this is because not all the soap is rinsed off.

This is my first experience with an Electrolux product and I was looking forward to owning one. I purchased the 4.3 Cu. Ft. Front Load Washer with IQ-Touch‚Ñ¢ Controls featuring Perfect Steam in March and had it installed on the 23rd (2015). It is now April 25 and I hate this washing machine. I wish I had chosen a different brand. The technician has already been out once because I had a slow water leak coming down the front of the washer. The tech discovered there was a defect in the door, which created a gap large enough for water to pool inside the door. A new door is on order but it took two weeks for it to come in. I was approximately one week away from the new door arriving and the washer started having other issues. The washer developed a knocking sound when it went into the spin cycle and rocked more than it did when first installed. The spin cycle is so loud it is not conducive to a hold a normal conversation if near the washer or trying to watch television in the next room. In fact, the shaking and noise levels are so much louder and disruptive on this Electrolux then what I experienced with the 10-year-old washer I replaced. Even when on its &#34;last leg&#34;, my old washer never sounded or behaved as my new one does. This is horrible; I cannot believe I paid for a product that is already having numerous problems within the first month.<br /><br />Update:  Horrible Product -1st Review No longer on Electrolux Website<br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Interestingly, my first review (above) of this washer was removed from the Electrolux website; it was in no way inappropriate and 100% true. I am on my 2nd new washer in 6 months and the new one is now broken down with the same problem as the first one. I was told the pulley system slipped, causing a hole in the wash tub, which means I am once again without a washer for weeks at a time while waiting for repairs.",8/29/15,NEGATIVE

I have not had any difficult with ...,"This range exceeds all expectations for its appearance, value and seemingly sturdy build.  I have not had any difficult with the manner in which the burners ignite as other reviewers have.  You do have to hold in the knob for about 3 seconds to ensure the flame does not go out but I don't find this annoying.  The burners themselves are powerful and easy to adjust once you get accustomed to the function of the inner and outer rings of fire.  The oven does put out copious amounts of heat into the kitchen through the vent at the top of the oven door and it heats up the control knobs quite a bit.  I guess that is what you get when graduating to this high powered performer.  The oven heats up very quickly and the broiler works great.  I took delivery of the range during a southern California heat wave and the first time I fired up the oven it super heated my kitchen.  This range would be more appreciated during a cold night in Minesotta but probably not where I live where it rarely gets below 40 degrees.  The most troubling aspect to this range and the reason I did not give it 5 stars is the lack of adjustability of the height.  If you compare it to almost every other range in existence you will find that its maximum height adjusted with the feet is below what most installations will require.  So my installer had to custom fit some lumber under the legs of my new 3K range to get it to the proper height. Unacceptable.  I guess the designers were in a coma when they configured the dimensions.  Also, they stupidly fit a HUGE power cable that sticks straight out from the wall plug at least 3 inches making it impossible to slide the range anywhere near to the back wall.  So again, my professional and very astute installer had to run an extension cord. He cautioned me to remove it if I ever need service because F&P would void the warranty. By the way, the flush designed power cord pictured in the F&P manual that would have worked perfectly is no where near the style that is supplied with the range.  Again, a real disappointment from a design perspective.  I got the range for $2999.00 and a promotion included a $600.00 over the range microwave for free.  So this was a real value if you compare it to other brands where the entry point for just the range is probably $3500.00.  I also got the F&P refrigerator and DishDrawer which both work great.  This is a very stylish suite of appliances.",8/29/15,POSITIVE

Capacity Steam Washer/Dryer Combination with TurboWash, TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System, NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum, Allergiene Cycle in White",Major Appliances,1,25,30,N,Y,Drying did not work.,"I really wanted this combo unit to work. The unit has great options for washing clothes and is quite. However, the dryer feature did not work or was malfunctioning on the unit i received. What I noticed about the drying feature on my unit is that I could hear it spraying bursts of water into the machine when it was on the dry cycle. So the result was hot wet clothes when the machine cycle ended. How wet you ask? They were soaked, I could wring out the water and get them more dry by hand then this machine could do on an 3 hour dry cycle. Like others who purchased this machine I knew that the clothes would have a damp feeling after washing/drying. That is not the case with this machine, my clothes are soaked. Perhaps your still thinking I did not &#34;really&#34; know how to use this machine. For a test I put in completely dry clothes into this machine, turned on just the dryer and can you guess what happened? Thats right! The clothes came out wet! Weird... Anyways, I did some other tests and I found out if I removed the drain hose to a bucket on the floor the clothes would come out almost dry but I had to keep an eye on the bucket because it would fill up twice before the dry cycle ended. The reason why I moved the drain hose to a bucket is because the water did not create a hydro-lock and I let gravity drain the water out. LG did however do their best to help me. They do not have a rep that repairs in my area so I have to return this one and they will cut me a check. But like I said earlier I really wanted this machine to work and now I have to go through the motions of replacing it. Unfortunately, I do not have the confidence that I will replace this unit with the same one. I will look elsewhere.<br />If you're on the ropes about buying one yourself then consider yourself warned. I'd say you have a 50/50 chance you'll get a unit that will give you damp clothes over soaked clothes. Either way you're getting one or the other. And I was one of the people who said to myself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!yself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!",8/28/15,NEGATIVE

Here are some things we discovered about the Miele after it was installed.<br /><br />1) It can take anywhere from a minimum of 3 to 7 punches of the touch control buttons to get the burner on and to the level you wish. You have press to turn the whole unit on, press to turn the specific burner on, and press for the specific setting either once more (for very high or very low) or multiple times if you want a medium setting like 5.<br /><br />2) The controls are not at all intuitive.  No guest at our home (we tested about a dozen) was successful in operating the stove without a tutorial.  The markings on the touch pad do not give you a clue about what should be pressed and in what order.  You cannot disable the lock on the whole unit, and few people realized that the stove unit needed to be unlocked before you go to a specific burner.<br /><br />3) The controls are not very sensitive.  Some people's fingers produced very inconsistent responses for some of the touch screen buttons. Almost everyone made the mistake, when first trying, of not holding their finger on the pad long enough for it to respond.  It takes a lot longer than most touch pads on most other devices.  But for some fingers it took multiple presses on a button to get a response and in some cases would not respond at all.  There was a lack of touch responsivity  about 30% of the time.  The technical support staff, when called, recommended changing the room lighting  (it's light sensitive) and &#34;using the middle finger&#34; instead of the index finger, but these did not really help.  There is actually a youtube video showing some of these problems with another model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KItZaAM8Jtk.<br /><br />4) The unit and all the burners arbitrarily shut off quite frequently. A misplaced touch can do it, as can the presence of some object on the top of the range.  Then you need to go through the multiple punch routine to get it going again.<br /><br />5) The top itself, while shiny and cool looking, is also so slick that pots and pans can easily slide around, sometimes sloshing out their contents.<br /><br />The good news is that Miele did agree to take the unit back and give us a refund. Still I urge the industry to rethink the controls on these units and make more working units available to customers to try out in showrooms to see if it really suits them.bject on the top of the range.  Then you need to go through the multiple punch routine to get it going again.<br /><br />5) The top itself, while shiny and cool looking, is also so slick that pots and pans can easily slide around, sometimes sloshing out their contents.<br /><br />The good news is that Miele did agree to take the unit back and give us a refund.

I started doing my own research on Ionized Alkaline Water machines and really liked the price and quality of the Life Ionizer and started communicating with the company about their machine. The customer service was outstanding and has been for the past three years since buying my machine. I share the water with friends and neighbors and they all really like the taste of clean fresh tasting water. The city water here in Huntsville Alabama has a lot of chlorine in the water. now as soon as I put a glass of tap water up to my nose to drink it when I am away from home I can hardly stand it. We cook with the water, make coffee and tea with it and believe me you can really tell the difference. I personally recommend the Life Ionizer machine and hope you will take a serious look the the companies line of products if you are thinking about a water machine.

When it spins, it almost completely dries most of my laundry. The only negative I have is that I needed the water hammer eliminators. They were 9.99 at lowes (1 for cold & hot). It would have been nice if they were included because from what I've read from reviews, it's a frequent issue with this machine. I can look way past that though. My 3-yr old had an upset stomach when he woke up.  He threw up on his sheets. We rinsed them off, but there was a red stain on them that I assumed would be there forever.

My family and I use a lot of ice daily, especially me. The cost of purchasing ice at the store added up quickly - we went through two or more bags of ice each week at a cost of $2 for a 10 lb bag of ice. Easily we were spending at least $20 per month on ice. We purchased ours at Sam's Club for $99, so after about 5-6 months we have more than recovered what we would have spent on purchasing bags of ice.<br /><br />For those who have complained that their units do not work, there is usually a 30-day period to ask for a replacement or refund. Looking at the overall positive reviews, it would seem that malfunctioning units are the exception rather than the rule. The item that we purchased has worked flawlessly since we purchased it, more than a year ago.<br /><br />I don't know if everyone puts it to use in the same way. We use it to keep a full supply of ice in our freezer at all times. If we run low, we just fill the ice maker with water and let it do its thing. It only drops a handful of ice at a time, so if you were waiting for enough ice to fill your cup, you might get frustrated waiting. So we turn it on when our ice supply drops, and pass by occasionally to dump the ice into the freezer ice container. The ice maker will stop making ice and an indicator light will go on if the tray gets too full, or if the machine runs out of water.<br /><br />I saw the reviews of other ice addicts who were very happy with this ice maker.

I am a single guy and I have a mix of office clothing and casual and the usual mix of sheet, towels, etc.  I was becoming unhappy with air drying because many items were a little stiff and scratchy with air drying (mainly towels and jeans).  I just got the dryer last night and I have dried two loads.  Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />It is slightly larger than my Panda washer which does 6-7 lbs of clothes.  It is heavier and is constructed of steel like a real washer, but of a thinner gauge of metal.  Seems very well constructed, given the price and that it is essentially &#34;portable&#34; or small-sized.  Seems like it will last.  Well packed in a large box with padding.  No damage in shipping.  No strange chemical or plastic smell at all out of the box, unlike the Panda washer.<br /><br />I had no 'loose belt' issue (read some other reviews) -- the dryer worked immediately.  The noise level:  louder than the Panda Washer (which is very quiet) but quieter than a hair dryer by a fair margin.  In fact the sound does sound sort of like a cross between a regular full sized dryer and a hair dryer. I was able to watch television in the next room (no closed door) without a problem, and I'd say this is no louder than machines in a laundry room.<br /><br />I load my Panda 6-7 lb washer close to capacity every load. As a single guy, I do laundry once per week with my Panda washer (highly recommended).  By the time the second load was washed, the first load in the dryer was dry enough for me to take it out of the dryer.  The first load was dried with the 'low heat' setting.  The second load, towels and such, I left running and went to bed.  The timer was set to about 30 or 40 min with the &#34;high heat&#34; button pressed in.  This morning, my towels were soft, and bone-dry.  So were the things I washed in the first load -- and everything was SOFT and FRESH (I used 'linen' scented liquid fabric softener from Target) -- unless air drying, which leaves everything wrinkled.<br /><br />With darks or not very soiled colors, using the Panda, it takes me 3 minutes to fill machine; 8 minutes wash time; 3 minutes to drain and fill for rinse; 5 minutes for rinse agitation; 5 minutes to drain and spin.  That is  about 24 minutes per load.  At high heat, with a not-over-filled dryer load, your first load will be close to dry by the time your second load is ready.  This will depend on fabrics and your heat setting.<br /><br />I specifically got this model, which is slightly larger than the smaller 5 lb load capacity dryer which is also available with slight variances from various vendors, because I usually do between 2-4 loads when I wash, and I want the extra size to dry up to 2 loads of wash in the dryer simultaneously. So far, I am very pleased, because it seems that this thought process is accurate.  I expect that my stuff dried quickly because the dryer was slightly loaded.<br /><br />A commercial or full sized dryer would do the job in about half the time, but those other machines are capable of much higher temps.  This little guy cannot match the big boys, but if the goal is to be productive in your home while taking care of laundry, this is a great route to take.<br /><br />Between the washer and this dryer, I have now spent $500 or so on the 'at home' laundry experiment.  I fretted over whether I really &#34;needed&#34; a dryer and whether around $300 for the dryer was too much money.  My worries are gone.  This machine does a beautiful job of drying towels, clothes, and does it  a bit quicker than the time estimates I found in other reviews.  The container will easier fit my King bed sheets or 2 Panda washer loads, yet the dryer is still small enough to be only slightly larger than the Panda and I can move it easily (though I am a pretty big and strong fella, so your mileage may vary).  Great device.<br /><br />I have purchased a steam iron and a ironing pad and have decided to learn to iron and avoid dry cleaners as much as possible, since my experience is that white shirts end up missing button, stained, or wear out too quickly at a commerical laundry.  I never thought I'd become a laundry hobbyist...lol...<br /><br />Only con is that I wish that it were cheaper and perhaps on wheels to make it easier to move.",8/28/15,POSITIVE

We choose the gas over electric this time, and I am so happy we did, gas dries so much better than electric and your bill will be so much less to.<br /><br />The front loader washer is pretty sweet for sure. Everything is digital, just set to your settings, and will always remember what you picked, tells you how long it will take. Sings a song when it turns on, when its done, and sings a whole song to. Buttons are huge, and you only need to put your finger on the button and will set it. The only thing I wish was the digital board had a back-light for night-time using. The door is huge, opens and closes easy. The area for detergent is easy to reach and the bucket can sit on top and drip in easy. The door does lock shut, but there is a button for emergency release in case you have pranksters in your home. We also requested the bottom stowaway for each of them, they are huge and holds detergent, softener, and more easily.<br /><br />The front loader dryer is better with gas, and will save you money. I love how the door opens the same side as the dryer so you can pull items from the washer to right into the dryer. The drums of the two are the same size. They have bedding, delicate, wrinkle free, static free settings on the dryer. The dryer also is digital, with easy tapping buttons, tells you how long the dryer will take, and has a song for turning on, off, and when done. The settings per the two, with about the same settings, with the dryer taking only ten minutes longer, and these are both the simple settings. The dryer lint trap isn‚Äôt the best, super hard to take the lint out, as there is no place the release the actual plastic when you take it out, to remove it, so little fingers are the best to use for that.<br /><br />All in all we love these Samsung washer and dryer sets, you can find them retail for $999.99 and you can get rebates back up to $200 if you were to buy them at Home Depot or Lowe‚Äôs as seen on a commercial.  These are a huge step up to what we head top and front loaders from 2006, reaching almost ten years old, so these babies are AWESOME.

Overall, it does the job it was intended to do. I keep both red and white wines in it, by keeping the temperature at 56F. That's borderline low for red, and borderline high for white, so it's not perfect. But, I was prepared for that because it is a single-zone cooler after all.<br /><br />My wife and I don't drink that much wine (2 bottles a week, more if we have guests over). I had planned to purchase a second unit, so that we'd have one for red wines, and a separate one for white wines. But, we're happy with the borderline temperature setting so far.<br /><br />The spacing of the metal racks is barely sufficient for regular-size bottles. We have problems with any wine bottles that are wider or taller than usual, even if they are 750 ml. We end up having to use the space with no racks in order to stack wide bottles directly on top of each other.

Apartments cost a ton to rent, and space comes at a premium (in fact, apartments that have built-in dishwashers are often $100-$200 more per month, which adds up fast). Unfortunately, I'm also extremely lazy in that I hate doing dishes every day, or ever for that matter. It was getting to the point where literal mountains of dishes were cluttering my already space limited counters. I woke up one day, and decided this needed to change. I asked myself, &#34;What's the cheapest way to solve the problem of unending dirty dishes?&#34;. So I logged on my favorite dating app and got myself a nice girlfriend.<br /><br />I thought all my problems were solved. I was wrong. Very wrong.<br /><br />It turns out that getting a girlfriend actually INCREASED the amount of dirty dishes. I was shocked. Saddened. Deeply disturbed. Every night, I curled up in to a ball among my dishes and cried myself to sleep, hoping my tears would wash away the dried up Indian curry from a month ago, or loosen the cheese cement attached to my mac n' cheese bowl. Alas, it did nothing. About to give up, I turned to my previous dishwasher-turned-girlfriend and begged for help. After refusing any sort of manual labor plea, we eventually turned to our online friends and discovered the SPT countertop dishwasher. It was a match made in heaven. The SPT easily gobbled up all my dish-related problems and spit out gorgeous, piping-hot, sparkling clean dishes. All I have to do is throw a little dishwasher detergent packet it, click the hose on to the sink, and fire that puppy up. The little SPT box is so whisper quiet, you can practically hear the dishes sigh in relief as they deep soak all the previous months of abuse and neglect away.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.

After requesting a return on Amazon, I was contacted by the company about possibly just checking to make sure the cables were all plugged in for the touch panel.  While the instructions that they sent were clearly for a different model hood (so I disassembled more than I had to trying to follow the directions) I was able to re-seat a few cables and tighten the screws behind the touch panel to get it working again.  Customer service was very helpful and friendly. We found that the LEDs (while very bright) were also VERY yellow-toned.  We replaced them with similar, but not so yellow bulbs that matched a little better with our under cabinet lighting.  Installation was pretty simple as well.  We had to run a vent outside (we had no vent there), so that took quite a bit of time, but once we had it in place, the hood went up very quickly, but did require two sets of hands. The buttons work very well, and are very responsive to touch, and the hood does a pretty good job blowing steam and smells outside. I know some have complained about the noise, but I have to say-- most of the noise comes from the duct work.  Running it straight out of the box with nothing hooked up, it seemed VERY quiet.

I used  #10  1 1/2&#34; stainless screws with washers on 2 of the screws.  ( no room on the other 2 screws for washers).  The unit is quite solid and level.  The electrical wires are a bit short, but workable. Tech support advises hardwiring the unit, because of the fact that using a plug could max out the 15 amp service of kitchen GFCI's.  ( Again, more irony, because the power for the hardwiring comes from a 15 amp service from the kitchen GFCI's )  None the less, i opted for the plug in, with no problems.  The unit is fairly quiet.  Again this is subjective, because acoustics are different in each kitchen.  The unit, however does evacuate smoke for most cooking, but VERYPOORLY for the self cleaning feature of the range.  There is a mild increase in draw, as well as an increase in sound,  without the stainless grilles.  The grilles do catch grease, but they are flimsy and easily twist upon removal and insertion.  The  LED lights do a good job illuminating the stove.  We have a black stove with black 20x20 tiles on the black splash, and the added light is helpful.  Opening a window a few inches will help with the necessary make up air needed to ensure maximum air flow.  The controls are hard to see/use, and are not back lit.  To use them, I have  to duck down and look up under the lip of the vent hood. I imagine with time we'll memorize the button functions.  In summary, the unit works, but there are several things which took away from the perceived value of this unit.  Update:  After having this product for a couple of years, It is obvious that the draw is not near the rated CFM.  I personally installed the ducting and calculated the measurements per industry code.  Smoke will plume around the unit when cooking.  Frequently at greasy film is on top of the unit, telling me that it does not work as it should.",8/26/15,MIXED

READ YOUR WARRANTY!!!!!,"We bought this refrigerator in March of 2014 and there really were very few reviews about it at that time. I was very dismayed to see that Amazon's reviews of this product (with 33 reviewers at the time) granted a wapping 1-star. ONE! Even that is too much. You can't even fit two gallons of milk into either of the containers on the door! Nonetheless, it is an expensive refrigerator from Kitchenaid, so what could go wrong!?!?! Our ice make stopped working a few days ago and now our freezer isn't working. My wife called Kitchenaid twice today and they said that there was nothing they could do, but that she could be an extended warranty for a year for $339 and then they would fix it or that we could go on our own and fix it with another company. TWICE!!! I called and they finally came to grips. I found another user review on Google via Home Depot for this item that really helped me. The parts that fail are actually warrantied for years 2-5. CHECK YOUR WARRANTY .... they will not offer you this info. Here is a copy of it: http://www.kitchenaid.com/digitalassets/KFIS29PBMS/Warranty_EN.pdf. If that is too much work, I have pasted the important stuff below. Here is what you need to know and see though:<br /><br />SECOND THROUGH FIFTH YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY ON CAVITY LINER<br />AND SEALED REFRIGERATION SYSTEM<br />In the second through fifth years from the date of purchase, when this major<br />appliance is installed, operated and maintained according to the instructions<br />attached to or furnished with the product, KitchenAid brand will pay for factory<br />specified replacement parts and repair labor for the following components to correct<br />non-cosmetic defects in materials and workmanship in this part that prevent function<br />of the refrigerator and that existed when this<br /> major appliance was purchased:<br />‚ñ† Refrigerator/freezer cavity liner if the part cracks due to defective materials or<br />workmanship.<br />‚ñ† Sealed Refrigeration system (includes compressor, evaporator, condenser, dryer<br />and connecting tubing).<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />  It kills me to know, however, that I bought a lemon and will have to live with it and replace these parts again every 10-15 months until my 5 year warranty runs out. Believe me, I will not hesitate to use it over and over again until the 5 years are up or they get me another refrigerator that works. Poor quality and cost-cutting on their part is not going to help their bottom line this time! I hope this helps some of you as well. If you still encounter issues, please forward your problem to the office of your state's Attorney General. They eat this stuff up! :)",8/26/15,NEGATIVE

Mine arrived a few days ago in a timely manner. (I bundled it with other items and got free shipping - I'm not a Prime member). Installed very easily.  Unlike other reviewers, it took my filter over 15 gallons of water flushed through before the grayish carbon color dissipated. I still notice a slight gray tinge when I pour a pitcherful into a white sink. That 15 gallons cost me money and, although I watered my trees with most of it, I didn't appreciate &#34;wasting&#34; that money. I'll still be buying ice for a while because the ice cube mechanisms still have residual carbon bits that haven't flushed out. All-in-all, I'm sure I saved a little, but will try Whirlpool's own brand next time.  ****UPDATE ***** The folks (Jennifer) at Waterfall Filter Co. read my review and contacted me. She assured me that this was an unusually large amount of water to have to flush through the filter - should only be about 1 gallon - and suggested I may have received a faulty one. They sent me a replacement filter right away, at no charge!! The new filter did, in fact, only require 2 pitcherfuls, about 1 gallon, to flush the water through clearly. Good customer service.

Item came with a chip in the corner but I barely notice it and it doesn't affect the cycle.

Didn't buy it for laziness, just didn't have time to do dishes, so this was a life saver. Fits great on my counter, easy to install, easy to remove the hose attachment when you need the sink (when it's not running of course.

My son used it to make popcorn. We haven't had micro popcorn in a really long time. The front panel is a bit small so I think people with not great eyesight may want to consider that. If you look at it straight on and in good lighting, it isn't so bad but if it is at an angle with low lighting, the panel labels are a bit hard to discern.

White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,0,0,N,N,"washer smells horribly, must be cleaned-are you kidding","Called 8/24/15- spoke with representative about our two year old washer.Nothing Whirlpool can or will do.They have no other complaints about rust inside the lid and inside rim at bleach dispenser nor chipping of paint from lid. When asking the Whirlpool representative about the rust, he assured us there were no other complaints.This is hard to believe since our recent research clearly shows that other brands have had to replace tops due to rust. As for clothes not cleaning, no response to this issue. Whirlpool has not trained salespersons and therefore at the mercy of Lowes hard sales tactics and we were very delinquent in researching numerous complaints before purchasing Whirlpool Cabrio Platinum Model WTW8240YWD.Ranked lowest possible from Consumer Affairs with hundreds of complaints.Whirlpool should be ashamed of product, clothes do not come clean, there is no soak cycle, no way to open mid cycle without loosing all water, washer smells horribly, must be cleaned-are you kidding? Who cleans the washer that is supposed to clean clothes with a special cleaner?? We understand safety issues of water in open machine, wonder if Whirlpool understands the need to have a 'soak' feature to clean clothes.  Undereducated buyers like us and the totally undereducated salesperson at Lowes were obviously a horrible combination.It was all about sales for them. No one mentioned and we had no clue that the huge drum would not clean clothes even using less water than a traditional machine. We thought 'platinum' meant a high quality machine.  It clearly was a cleverly used buzz word for sales not a premier cleaning machine.Never, never, never purchasing Whirpool anything again. Wonder if Whirlpool cares, if they read the Consumer Affairs reports, if they respond. Our hard earned money is wasted. Our clothes are dirty, the washer smells, and the top is rusting out!",8/24/15,NEGATIVE

Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,0,0,N,Y,Love to nuke,"Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume.

I've tried contacting the seller, but have yet to get a response. I use this in conjunction with a breathing mobile washer and it's a great system for apartment living! **Update** I have since heard from the seller and they have more than made the situation right so I am now therefore pleased to give this 5 stars. Their product AND customer service has exceeded expectations. Today I was able to dry a full sized sheet with no trouble at all and it was sopping wet!",8/24/15,POSITIVE

What that does is trap food particles that end up washing back on the dishes. A terrible design in my opinion. What we have to do to get a relatively clean washing is to first remove every piece of food from our dishes in the sink. If we don't the food ends up dried on the dishes after the washing and drying cycles are done. Oh, and yes, we clean the filter weekly.",8/24/15,NEGATIVE

And has a somewhat quirky characteristic of forming frost on the inside rear wall of the refrigerator section, when the compressor is on, this then melts and is channeled away down a small hole when the compressor is off. Called a Cycle Defrost. The freezer section will require a manual defrost too. All in all the Avanti is good package for the $349 i paid for it at time of purchase.

Subsequently we bought my parents a similar model and they've *never* had a UE problem.

It held the temperature well IF the cooler was completely full. Over time it started to stray a few degrees from the set temperature, especially the upper portion, progressively getting worse. The unit also started getting noisier which should have been a tell-tale sign it was about to quit on us.<br /><br />Right about at the 1-year of ownership mark we came home and saw the external temperature reading for the top section indicating 93 degrees! I immediately opened it up and it was blowing hot air all over our wine bottles. I would've expected the thing to just plain give up, but really didn't expect it to turn in to a heater!<br /><br />I am not sure if this is a function of thermo-electric coolers in general, but every single one of them seems to last about a year and quit on you. I was hoping with the relatively high reviews on this one that it would be different, but you get what you pay for. Stay away from this one unless you want to buy a new fridge every few months.<br /><br />To HOMEIMAGE, wouldn't cost too much to have a shut-off when the unit goes a few degrees above room temperature.

I found that it all has to do with the water evacuation hose position. The hose MUST point downward and never turn upwards. The drying system requires all water to be pumped out so it can dry properly. If not, the water remains in the system and it can not dry the clothes. I could not reuse the pipe that my previous washer used as it was too high and forced the hose to point up. I had to run the hose down to a drain in the floor. Once I did this, all items, including heavy towels and jeans came out totally dry once done. I have a feeling lol those reviews claiming wet clothes are not draining water correctly and thus giving their review an unfair low rating.

Capacity in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,4,4,5,N,N,Really nice fridge!,"We recently replaced our Samsung, which in the 4 years since we bought it, had broken for the third time. We chose this LG which we have been happy with and there are a few features which make it really unique. We are a soccer family; coach, ref and both of our girls play, so we go through a LOT of ice. This fridge has two ice makers AND the ice cubes are smaller so when you are holding a sports water bottle up to the ice shute, the ice falls right in where old sized ice used to get stuck in the opening. It makes ice fast and the water is nice and cold which really helps. The rest of the features on the fridge are great too. The door-in-door works as expected although you have to make sure it is shut or else it will pop open. In addition, I would swear that our veggies and fruits are staying fresher longer. The space is organized well too. If I had one complaint it would be the location of the water spout. If you look closely at the picture, you would assume it comes out at the same location as the ice like most fridges but it doesn't; it comes out in the space above it which means it is above the eye level of smaller kids (say age 9 on down) and also is confusing to guests. Everyone who comes in the house uses their hand to push the water button with the cup in the ice area and it shoots water out down the front of them. It's kinda funny in a way but then there's the clean up to consider and people feel badly for making a mess which of course is silly but it is what it is. I have taken to giving people a run down of the fridge when they come for the first time and that works but is a bit of an inconvenience, especially if I forget. I don't know yet about the longevity of the fridge but if it is anything like the trouble free 10 years we have gotten out of our LG washer/dryer then I think we will be happy. The water also tastes really nice too. Very clean, like Ozarka.",8/23/15,POSITIVE

The freezer still works but we had to toss out everything from the fridge compartment due to a non-op fan & 50+ degree temps. I'm told that LG ships parts ground so if they're in stock it's usually a 3-5 day wait. If the part is on back order I'm expecting an additional 2-3 week wait.<br /><br />My wife and I really liked this model, particularly being the largest capacity counter depth we could find.

I can tell you, that yes, it does dry clothes. I bought this for drying my daughters cloth diapers and for trying it out in regards to Tiny House's and Tiny House living. If you want this for a small area, I don't recommend it unless you have a really good air filtration system. Why? Because it makes the room it's in very humid and for a Tiny House, humidity can be your worst enemy. That being said it would probably be fine if you put it in the bathroom and turned a good bathroom fan on.<br /> I put 5 or 6 prefold diapers that were hand rung, so still pretty soaked, into the tent and it took 4 hours to mostly dry them. So it works. It's like a quick version of hanging over night. They aren't fluffy like when they are in a tumble dryer. Minerals in the water set and made my diapers a bit stiff, but if you have a spin dryer or a spin cycle with your washer this type of mineral setting isn't such a problem. I imagine drying would be quicker and maybe even less humid. But if you are using a portable hand washer, you'll have to keep what I've said in mind while using this product.<br /><br />The reason I said it's sketchy is because when you turn the timer on, it sparks. Like a pilot light in a propane stove. SPARK* it makes me nervous. Also it looks like some college kid jerry rigged a hair dryer into a kids play tent and was like, this will work! and it does. but still seems like it could be a hazard if you aren't careful with it.<br /><br />I did like that you could fold up the tent into a small bag. It came with 2 clipped hangers with multiple clips on each wrack. I didn't like that the metal hang lines down't fold up into the bag or box without unscrewing them.<br /><br />If you are unsure about buying this product, I'll be posting a more complete review on my blog, www.tinyakadventure.com",8/23/15,POSITIVE

As I didn't want lint clogging the fan, or cluttering up my front yard, I purchased this lint trap. I had seen it used on the TV show Holmes Inspection (available on Netflix) and thought it a great idea. My previous system of venting into an external water trap in my 3 season porch had resulted in an horrible accumulation of lint all over the place, not to mention the fire hazard of flexible ductwork filled with lint.<br /><br />So, I'm happy to report that this does a very good job of stopping lint from progressing through my ductwork. After 5 months enough lint has reached the outside vent fill my hand (not much).<br /><br />To get it offset from the wall, and give room for the fan which I placed immediately above it, I mounted this on doubled blocks of 2x6 that I rounded off a bit and painted white before attaching with deck screws to my wall. Then I put screws right through the corners of this trap. It isn't going anywhere. I had a bit of trouble getting a decent seal to the 4 inch flexible ducting from my dryer, and it does whistle a tiny bit, but it looks OK and is functional.<br /><br />My one real issue (and I don't know if this is solvable) is that to clean the trap, I have to jerk the cover out of the box, and this action invariably brings a spray of dryer debris (little bits of hardened paper, etc.) which I have to wipe off my washer--which is immediately below this trap. As others have pointed out, the cover does not fit quite square in the box, but this might just be to allow the cover to come out at all. It doesn't appear to leak hot moist air into the room, which would be an actual problem.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone willing to listen to my epic story of installing a 30 foot dryer vent.",8/22/15,POSITIVE

We figured we were moving in a year so we didn't bother wasting more of our time. Their &#34;windows&#34; of service where ridiculous and forced us to end up taking four days off work for three visits. Why four...because one of the days they were supposed to be here between 10 and 2.......their technician called in sick which we didn't find out until 3:30 when they finally returned out call from 2:00 on the dot.<br /><br />This microwave looks great...the features seem decent enough. The problem is that the door latch broke loose inside the door which cannot be serviced...only replaced...the lowest bid from two local repair companies.....$260 bucks...this piece of garbage sells NEW on Amazon for $299.99.<br /><br />We considered buying it again because it matches the other appliances (ALL have major problems that either cant be fixed or cost nearly as much as a new unit) but here is no way I can let myself screw over the next owners as we have our house listed for sale. We are spending $125 more on a microwave that has a proven record...unfortunately it is also from the Electrolux Corporation that makes SOOOO many brands of appliances.<br /><br />I remodel kitchens for a living and I steer ALL clients away from the Frigidaire Gallery line of appliances. The problem with today's appliances isn't unique to low, middle or high end appliances. As far as service after the sale..they all suck. Don't buy &#34;newer&#34; models until folks have had time to review then after YEARS of use. I have a kitchen I did for a couple that spent nearly $25,000 on their Jenn-Air ovens, stove, refrigerator, dishwashers, and under counter ice machine. Every single one has had the repair guy out at least once...the two double ovens they bought...SEVEN visits, THREE control boards and underwhelming performance forced this couple to upgrade their entire kitchen to Viking.....not sure how much but probably in the realm of $40,000.<br /><br />My washing machine went out and I was looking at spending $1,200 until I looked at Consumer Reports...they rated mine high...but they rated a $350 top load machine higher...how could this be?

Without fail, they stock the Speed Queen.  After digging deep onto various forums regarding the machines, I was sold.  I have had my SQ unit for a week.  It runs perfect.  It cycles in under 30 minutes, spins clothes dry (unlike the #2 unit I ditched), and cleans them.  The added option of being able to add more water is a plus, but not one that I use.  Thank you Speed Queen and to the guy that sold me my third washing machine I have ever owned (only because the 2nd one was so bad).  I have faith that the unit will last me 25+ years like my previous Maytag did.",8/22/15,POSITIVE

The only things I can think of is others have either:<br /><br />A: neglected to &#34;unlock&#34; the wheels to the rolling position after arrival. (All wheels come &#34;locked&#34; you need to lift the lever on each one before installing to get them to roll).<br /><br />Or<br /><br />B: they are rolling the washer long distances, over multiple types of floors, and putting too much pressure on the machine while doing this.<br /><br />By no means are these industrial strength but, I installed on my machine (I have one of the larger capacity ones and is heavier than the standard) and have rolled back and forth from my dining room to kitchen (about 5 or 6 feet, transitioning from hardwood to kitchen tile) probably about 10-15 times so far and have had no issues whatsoever. Nothing has broke and at no time is the machine ever unsteady. I do take my time rolling with minimal pressure and make sure to lift very slightly from the transitions between rooms. Again, no issues, machine doesn't rock or move at all during washing, and at no time has anything seemed on the verge of breaking.<br /><br />If neither A or B applies to those who have broken wheels, well then my opinion is you may have just gotten a bad bunch. As long as you're realistic on how much pressure and distance these wheels can take (and you have them set in &#34;unlock&#34; to roll) I foresee no issues with these.

It has both normal and gentle agitation. The drain hose lowers to empty wash, rinse, and extraction water.  Excess water is removed from laundry by lowering the drain hose and selecting either &#34;normal&#34; or &#34;gentle&#34; agitation. The agitator will wring wet laundry by twisting it clockwise and counterclockwise. Once the tub is empty of either wash or rinse water, select &#34;drain&#34; for 5-6 minutes by the timer.  This is an excellent semi-automatic washer. Instead of spinning a basket, the Useful washer employs its oscillating agitator to &#34;twist&#34; soaked laundry. This simulates hand wringing. Importantly, the oscillating action prevents laundry balling or roping as occurs with clockwise only rotation. Individual pieces of laundry can be removed after &#34;twist and drain&#34;.  This is one of the better class of washers. The oscillating agitator not only washes and rinses, but wrings as well.  To conclude, if the oscillating control switch were labeled &#34;wash and wring&#34;, this would probably help. The real problem is that the instructions for this machine state, &#34; (4...drain the water by laying down the drain hose. Twist the laundry...) As with the control switch, there is a very subtle lack of information about the agitator spin wringing. However, there are 3 identical characters on the impeller or agitator that resemble the Easy Washing Machine Co. trademark. Easy marketed the vacuum washing machine. The vacuum bells washed, rinsed, and extracted laundry in the tub of water.  The more complicated washers employ some type of rotary spinning device to extract more water than the agitator wringing method widely possible. However, the superior &#34;twisting&#34; water extraction of the Useful washer prepares damp laundry for either line or machine drying.  I highly recommend JMilesCO.com for professionally qualified sale of the Useful washer. 5 stars across the board --way to go!ross the board --way to go!",8/22/15,POSITIVE

For instance, this gets 5 stars as a portable washer when no hook up is available not as a replacement for a top of the line hook up washer.  I have been using my Panda Washing Machine with Spin Dryer for 2 months now. It has been wonderful for me living in an apartment with no washer/dryer hook up. When it first arrived I was worried b/c the delivery service had left it upside down in the rain outside of my covered front porch. As soon as I saw it, I brought it in and dried it off as much as possible. I immediately contacted Panda, and they handled my concerns with professionalism and care. It turned out that my drying efforts were sufficient and the machine is operating without hiccups 2 months later, but I still appreciate the customer service I received in the face of my concerns.  Here are some things I have done to get the most out of my washer: 1) I'm using 2 additional filters, 1 floating one that I've tied to the side and one that I've attached to the end of the drain hose. 2) I put it on a coffee table so that when it drains I don't get water stuck in the hose. 3) I use my extendable shower head to fill the washer rather than the hose provided because you have to hold the hose provided the entire time it's filling if you're using hot water. 4) Do not use garment bags. This machine is rough and will tear your delicates and garment bags. I've been using cheese cloth bags with the strings tucked inside and those have been holding up much better. Hope you guys enjoy yours too!",8/21/15,POSITIVE

It is completely normal for the unit to run all the time to keep the wine bottles cool. The unit runs on fans, so in order to maintain temperature the fans need to be running. Please let me know if have any other questions or concerns.&#34;  We contacted them again to clarify they meant it should run 24/7 and the reply was &#34;Yes, the fans will be running constantly.&#34;  Personally we don't think it's appropriate for a cooler to run constantly especially when it has reached the set temperature.  Our refrigerator doesn't do that!  If you don't care that an appliance runs 24/7 then this would probably be a good buy for you.  We, however, are very disappointed in our purchase.<br /><br />One other note - the user manual that comes with the cooler states clearances of 1&#34; all around.  The NewAir website states 5&#34; clearances are needed.  The user manual included states ambient temperatures of around 75-80.  The user manual you can download from the website states 50-80.  Someone at NewAir should review their user manuals and get them in sync.",8/21/15,NEGATIVE

It is narrow and fits thru our 19 inch wide linen closet door where we store it.<br /><br />MEASUREMENT NOTE: The machine is around 17&#34; wide but the outlet drain hose does stick out the side and extra inch and half (so you have to add about 2 inches to the over width). The good thing here is that you have the option to switch the outlet drain hose to either the left or right side of the machine. You will also have to acknowledge that the inlet hose sticks up at the back and adds an extra 3 to 4 inches to the height (see the pictures I posted up).<br /><br />We had big leakage out the back and at the inlet connector during the first wash but once a proper wrench was used to tighten connectors with  thread seal tape there was no more leakage. We are only using this for our newborn clothes and burp clothes. This is a slight and most delicate machine so if you plan on washing heavy denim jeans, winter coats and shoes or you are using it every day then dont expect a long life out of this machine.<br /><br />The added BONUS is the spin cycle takes about 80% to 90% of the water out the clothes so you dont really need to buy a Dryer if you can spare 8 hours for line dry. Again we are only washing baby clothes so if you are washing heavy fabrics expect different results.<br /><br />Over all for the price this is a great product..",8/21/15,POSITIVE

The instructions are easy enough to understand on the card it came with, but the sticker on the front of the surge protector is in another language, so I am sticking the little business card sized instructions on the wall next to where I plugged it into. I plugged in the stand alone freezer, and waited and the green light is on. It has other settings to fix if any issues come up, but I feel more secure knowing that at least my freezer is safe if we have more power outages and surges, which happens fairly often here.

Feels and looks like red cedar but there is hardly any aroma to it.<br /><br />This has a major air circulation problem, once you fill the unit up, it will start to malfunction.  This is apparently a big problem with this product. Check cigar forums, it's a known and unaddressed problem.  I unfortunately did not do my research before getting this.  Don't make the same mistake.  The lack of circulation causes the unit to fritz out and have really bad temperature fluctuations. The lowest I've measured is 52 degrees and the highest is 78 degrees (room temp). This is all while the unit is set at 65 degrees. Next the unit cannot and will not maintain humidity, there is major air leakage in and out of the unit causing humidity to mirror room humidity. Beads can't keep up with it.<br /><br />The manufacturer is aware of these issues but their response is basically for you to return it to Amazon. Good thing I figure out these issues within 30 days.

If you do the research on these coolers, a lot of them don't even state their energy usage which is a good hint that they are terribly wasteful.  The unit states that it has Dynamic Cooling which is marketing speak for a fan. The fan blows air around the unit so that temperatures are more uniform and you won't get those hot and cool spots. I've never really had a problem with nonuniform cooling in my old cooler, but hey, it can't hurt!  With the adjustable feet screwed all the way in, the unit measures almost exactly (minus 1/16 inch) 34 inches. Keep this in mind when measuring out the space.  Overall a nice looking, reasonably priced, and very energy efficient little cooler. One star off for a sorely missing handle.",8/20/15,POSITIVE

I and am now looking to upgrade but thought I would review it here. I bought from Air and Water Inc. Its a single zone and I have had no problem with it. As others have mentioned, this is not a high end cooler. It is quiet with only a little fan noise that dies down when it reaches temperature. The bottle lay out is a little tight but I have never tried to pack it full. Occasionally it will not reach the low set point, for me ~56F. When this happened the first time, I could not figure out what was going on. However, I pulled the unit out and found a square foam air filter over the fan on the back of the unit that was full of dust. I washed this filter out and put it back in. Presto, it went back to keeping temperature. This has happened twice in the three years I've had this and both times I was able to fix the problem by washing the filter. Nothing in the manual about cleaning this filter but it has worked for me. Overall, for the price I paid, it was worth it.",8/20/15,POSITIVE

My biggest complaint is how incredibly difficult it is to get this oven to maintain a constant temperature. If I want to bake something at 350 degrees I have to set it to at least 400. If I set it at 350 it never gets hotter than about 275. Then once I get it preheated to the temperature I want I have to constantly monitor it. I purchased an oven thermometer and that's the only way I can tell how hot it is. The temperature tends to vary all the time; I've had it jump from 350 to almost 500 in less than 10 minutes WITHOUT my touching the control! It will also go to the cold side..it's a real juggling act to keep a steady temperature.<br />I had a technician from our local Gas Company come to inspect the oven and calibrate it and he said he couldn't calibrate the thermometer because this oven doesn't have the part needed to do so!

Overall it's a nice looking fridge, however when it comes to performance it misses the mark. The first issue we had was the temperature setting, the lowest temperature you can set the fridge to is 38F, however the temperature readout on the front bezel indicates that the coldest it ever gets is 46F. Secondly, the door lock is really finicky, it requires a decent amount of force to properly engage it. If not properly engaged, you can expect to have semi-chilled contents inside your fridge. Lastly, and this is the biggest issue we've had, is the condensation inside the fridge. For some reason, this fridge creates and exorbitant amount of condensation inside it, so much so that we've had to line the bottom of the inner compartment with a towel, which we replace daily, in order to soak up all the condensation. When we replace this towel every morning, it is fully saturated with water (aka dripping wet).  We've contacted the manufacturer regarding this and they've been of little to no help. They asked us to ensure that the door was fully locked, and that we weren't using it in a high humidity environment, two criteria which we met. Given that the market selection for other fridges of this capacity is lacking, we have come to terms with having to swap out wet towels every morning and triple checking our door lock. Unless you really need a fridge this size, I would recommend getting something else that is either smaller or larger than the goFridge.",8/20/15,NEGATIVE

The initial charge is $306.03, with a credit of $60 when the defective board is returned to them, for a final cost of $246.03.  Add to this the service charge from the technician.  Considering that this machine had light, infrequent use and cost more than $650 new, the price of the part and the repair are unreasonable.  Although other reviews note the same part defect, Whirlpool feels no culpability.  This is not your mom or dad's Whirlpool and these models are not made to last.  I won't buy another Whirlpool (or Maytag which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool).",8/20/15,NEGATIVE

My initial refrigerator BRFB1800SSIM had an ice maker that would not release ice cubes and had water freezing in the ice bin. A repairman was sent to replace the ice maker unit. The problem was not resolved. Blomberg's service provider Eastern Marketing noted this was a known problem. A fix from the factory was pending for several months from late 2014, but by mid-2015, Eastern Marketing concluded a completely new refrigerator would have to be installed. A year after initial contact, a new BRFB1822SSL was delivered, and installed (at my expense). The ice maker again failed after 2-3 weeks. The design of the ice maker is faulty. Ice does not release from the ice tray, and water flows over the ice tray, further freezing the tray in place. Excess water flows into the ice bin and freezes. The cycle repeats and the tray becomes increasingly caked with ice, further preventing ice from dropping out of the tray.  Update 1: It is currently 2015-12-29 and I am still awaiting a response from Eastern Marketing and Blomberg. See reviews for BRFB1800SSIM.  Update: As of January 2016, the ice-maker was redesigned and installed on my replacement BRFB1822SL with a quick 30-minute service visit. The new design is improved by over-torquing the ice tray, twisting the tray gently to ensure the ice separates from the tray. The ice tray rotates twice per tray-refilling cycle, allowing &#34;two tries&#34; to twist the ice out of the tray. The amount of water dispensed into the tray is reduced, thereby making smaller ice cubes and preventing joint ice-cubes from consolidating on the tray. I am satisfied enough to improve my rating to 4 Stars, with one deducted for the previous inconvenience discussed above. I never thought I'd be so happy to hear the sound of ice falling into a tray.  Update 2: I spoke too soon... After 3-4 successful batches of ice, the problem re-occurred. This time the water misses the ice tray completely, spewing water all over the ice-bin. Beyond unbelievable. I will post a video shortly.",8/18/15,NEGATIVE

The instruction manual is confusing when explaining the grill function. By trial and error, I discovered that frozen baguettes and pizzas come out wonderful, but chicken nuggets and fish fingers -- not so much.<br />The unit has extra insulation for the grill function. For shorter cooking times, the oven works like a 1000W unit, but longer times, it heats up like a lot more powerful unit. The insulation may also contribute to the fact that microwave is very quiet in operation.<br />All in all, this is a worthy replacement to my departed Samsung.

It creates perfectly clear ice thanks to the industrial design of always having water move over the cooling elements. It makes ice fast.  It also doesn't drip water onto your counter like others that condensate on the door and when you open and close spew water over the edges.  I dislike freezer made ice, it's design is all wrong for a round glass.  My last portable ice maker, bullet style, finally corroded the wiring from its door condensation issue and wasn't worth the fix.  This ice melts slower than the bullet.

My wife is very happy to have it back in order with a working light and fan. The fan might not be the most quiet on the market but it is much better than what we had. I highly recommend this product and seller.,8/18/15,POSITIVE

Life really is good when you have pedestals to raise the washer and dryer to a Laundromat type level. It is so much easier to get wash in and out of the washer and dryer. Before I was really having trouble with my old washer and dryer, mostly because the buttons were not working right and it was difficult to get clothes out of the washer and into the dryer.<br /><br />Now as far as research goes I read all about this set before I bought it. It had all the fun features I knew I'd love. But it was a surprise when I heard all the cute sounds this washer and dryer make. There are little tunes that are played at the end of the cycles which makes me happy. It is so much better than an annoying beeping sound.<br /><br />I would have to say that \\""user friendly\\"" is an understatement when talking about how easy this set is to use. With just a few turns of a knob and the pressing of a few buttons you can customize your experience. I have tried about ten options on the washer so far but there are even more to try. You can do regular cycles like cotton or perma press or delicates. There are also cycles for towels and whites. If you have allergies you will love the allergiene cycle which does take about an hour and a half but leaves sheets very, very clean. There is also a sanitary cycle a heavy duty cycle and speed wash cycle. I tried the speed wash cycle and it was only fifteen minutes. This was handy as I just needed to wash a few items. Now I don't have to wait for my favorite clothes. I can wash and dry them very quickly.<br /><br />The only cycle I had issues with on the washer was the perma press cycle with cold water. I tried washing my husband's and my clothes together and with cold water the scent of his deodorant got on all my clothes. So next I did a prewash (with Clorox 2) and extra rinse and used warm water. That turned out great and my clothes were fresh and clean. So I don't think I'll be using cold water as much with this machine. The washer also has a rinse and spin cycle but not a simple spin cycle.<br /><br />The only thing I had trouble washing so far was a very heavy flannel duvet/comforter cover. It simply would not spin. So I had to wring it out in the bathtub and finally got enough water out of it so I could put it in the dryer. So when they say \\""bulky\\"" items not everything heavy is going to work. But small blankets came out great. Like the kind you use on a baby's bed or cat bed.<br /><br />The washer also has a child lock option for if you have small kids. There is also an option to customize a cycle. So if you do a similar kind of laundry all the time this will save you some time as it saves your cycle and remembers it.<br /><br />The dryer is also very easy to use. You can turn a knob to select steam, small load, heavy duty, bulky/large, perm press, delicates, towels, speed dry and air dry. There is also a way to download another cycle of your choice. Both the washer and dryer work with cell phones. You can select a cycle and then change the dry level, temperature, time and signal. The dryer comes with a rack so you can dry shoes or delicates that you have to lay flat. There is an easy iron option if you don't want clothes you want to iron to dry completely before ironing. And there is a cool wrinkle care option that will tumble clothes longer until you get the chance to get them out of the dryer.<br /><br />What I really like about both the washer and dryer is the indicator symbol lights. You always know how much time is left and you can see a little symbol that tells you how far along the cycle is. There is also a child lock feature on the dryer. The dryer also has a custom setting for your favorite cycle. For safety there is a little \\""flow sense duct blockage sensing system.\\""<br /><br />Really this washer and dryer have it all. Just make sure to really read the manuals before using. There are some safety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again. What was the most fun was fluffing up my feather pillows on air dry. That only took a few minutes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewfety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again.

Installing this was a frustrating experience.  And I am an engineer myself and thought i had all the right parts, but found out I was wrong.  I even called Tech Support to explain and complain.  They were able to track down why I was having issues.  Here is what you need to know:  1. One port is slightly larger than the other, as they made this unit only to be mounted in non-flex 4&#34; duct.  However, the box is symmetrical and neither port is marked.  One is 4' in exterior diameter and the other is about 3.85&#34; in diameter.  No markings of any kind, so beware of this point, as once you remove the face/inner filter, it is easy to get the box turned around.  2. As I pointed out to Tech Support and they agree, but have no explanation for WHY - the lint filter, which is attached to the face of the unit at the same angle as the handle, DOES NOT TOUCH THE BACK OF THE BOX.  Thus, there is an air gap of about 1/4&#34; to 3/8&#34; between the inner edge of the lint filter and the back of the box.  This provides a LINT BYPASS which makes no sense at all.  It is, after all, a lint trap.  Tech Support is aware that customers are frustrated by this and resolving it with peel and stick foam window insulation, which is $2.50 per roll.  3. Tech Support is also aware that the face of the box leaks air.  Once again, you have to use some foam window seal tape, such as MD foam window seal for Small Gaps, or similar product.  What is not clear until you get one in hand, is that you pull on the handle and the whole front (white) face of the box comes out and the filter is attached perpendicular to the face.  So, if the face does not fit tight, it leaks.  And that means it leaks hot air into your space, and for many, it means it leaks RADON GAS into your space.  Not a lot, but in some areas we have radon in the ground water, and when you dry clothes, you want that hot moist air, which could contain radon, to vent outside, not leak into your garage or utility room or condo.  In short, we spent 3 hours modifying (insulating) and installing and field engineering this to get it to work.  It is installed and working now and catching lint.  But, for the price, this product should include the following:  * 2 - 4&#34; screw clamps * 2- 4&#34; sleeve adapters (almost impossible to install without this!) * 4 mounting screws * one roll of self adhesive foam insulation tape and instructions on how to add it to the lint filter and the door face - BETTER YET, install this  at the factory in China and make the box air tight BEFORE you sell it! * Better instructions.  Nowhere in the instructions are the problems described above mentioned, nor is there any info that points out that one port is narrower than the other and should be used as the INLET (they look the same until you measure them, but they are different diameters).  The instructions only cover installation for fixed 4&#34; duct with an inline fan, and not for other applications.  Duh!  Why not?  All in all this product is barely usable for my application as a secondary lint filter with flex connectors on each side, but yet this is EXTREMELY COMMON APPLICATION.  The manufacturer needs to rework this product to make it easier to use and make it more comprehensive.  Buyer beware.  You will need a lot of extra parts and pieces to make this work.",8/17/15,NEGATIVE

I bought this refrigerator at a very reputable appliance store. The day they delivered I noticed that 2 of the 3 doors had indentations in them. Not an obvious dent but if you looked at the doors the right way you could see large indentations in the metal and it was like that straight from the factory. The store said they would replace the doors no problem, only issue is that it took almost 6 weeks for Kitchen Aid to send them the new doors. Also on day one the cover for the meat draw did not fit at all and would not stay on. They ordered a new one of those too. Not what you would expect on an expensive refrigerator.<br /><br />When they came to replace the doors I noticed right away that the new freezer door had a similar indentation in the same spot but it wasn't as noticeable. The service technician told me it's almost impossible to get a door on one of these that does not at least have a slight indentation in that spot (bottom middle of the freezer door) so I just accepted it not wanting to go through the hassle again. He also had two new meat draw covers. Neither of them fit! The next step now was to order and replace the side rails for the draw. Weeks later they came and replaced the rails that the cover connects to and it still did not work. After several more weeks of waiting they came back with some plastic washers, disassembled the entire meat draw again and added the washers. The meat draw cover STILL does not work. You can barley get it on and then it pops off as soon as you pull the draw open.<br /><br />About a week later I opened the left door and the head of one of the screws in the bottom door hinge popped off which resulted in another service call to have the old screw drilled out and replaced with a new one.<br /><br />So 6 months since purchase I've had the dealer here (including the owner) probably 6 times and still do not have a working cover to the meat draw.<br /><br />I will never buy aKitchen Aid appliance again.",8/16/15,NEGATIVE

Unfortunately this is only a temporary fix since it continues. My heater element was fine, temp sensor fine, ice just keeps building up in the top section and plugs the fan. There was a class action law suit on this but Samsung refuses to help folks resolve their design flaw. I see mine has a heater to drain element added in the design from the earlier models, but that only helps with the lower half of the coils. Sad to spend so much on a fine looking fridge to have it be a lemon and not be supported by Samsung even though they know they have a bad design.<br /><br />Also, the spring for the door flap broke which seals the 2 French doors. It was cheap to fix, but Samsung used poor quality metal in the spring and it's a cheapo design that is not robust. So plan on fixing the door flap after about 2-3 years.<br /><br />I really want to like this refrigerator since the features are nice and it's a good layout. I like the LED. Most early reviews are favorable since they haven't had the defrost fail yet. So I thought I check in after 4 years and warn folks. Google this problem and you'll see. Samsung continues to use this faulty design as far as I can see, so BUYER BEWARE.<br /><br />I will not be buying any more Samsung devices. No more phone will be Apple after the S3 is done, no more Ovens, no more TVs, Samsung is a real fail.",8/16/15,NEGATIVE

Same as the rinse cycle in a normal washer.<br /><br />The only con I would give would be the hoses. They work just fine but they're the typical plastic hoses that you know are going to break eventually.

I replied that a year and a half product should not have done this no matter what the timeframe. They asked what I wanted done and I told them I wanted a replacement and they said they would call me back. I didn't hear from them for a week and when I called back they said the would call back with the name of an authorized dealer to get it fixed.

I can't believe it is a GE. I had to replace our wonderful Asko after many years of good service. Because our counters are 1/2&#34; too low for standard height dishwashers and we live in a remote area, I had very limited choices available that I could buy online and I couldn't actually see it before I bought it. After one load, I can make only two positive points: 1) the unit fits under our counter, and 2) a reasonably gooey load of dishes did get clean and reasonably dry. The racks, rollers, utensil baskets and spray arms are made of flimsy plastic. Although the unit is the same size as the Asko, the racks are only 17&#34; deep (instead of 19&#34;). The top one only pulls out part way, reducing capacity and making it hard to load and unload. I don't know what &#34;fully integrated&#34; means. It does NOT mean quiet. After rattling and roaring on for nearly 2 hours on the first load, the wretched thing created a further commotion by flashing a whole string of green lights and making intermittent beeping sounds to celebrate the fact that it had completed its cycle.  This continued until I got up and manually turned it off. I'm glad it was happy, because I just wanted to cry. As for Square Trade, the jury is out. They promised &#34;same day&#34; shipping on July 19. It shipped on July 28 and finally arrived on August 4. The 3-year Square Trade Large Appliance Protection policy has yet to arrive. Somehow, I suspect I'm going to need it, although I might be happier just letting the thing die an early death. I would wait to write this review until I had more to report, but I've given myself only 48 hours to think about how annoying this dishwasher is before I pretend it just doesn't exist.",8/15/15,NEGATIVE

Do you enjoy colonoscopies without sedation? If yes to either question Then by George an LG Washing Machine would be right for you!<br />I had been tickled pink by my LG washer & dryer set for about 2 years. Until said washing machine flooded our townhouse whilst I was running it's Tub Clean cycle. If you own an LG washing machine, by the way, you will get to know that Tub Clean cycle Rather well as the unit constantly smells of rotting eggs. Anyway, this particular morning the washing machine decided to spew forth a torrential downpour that caused it to rain through the 2nd floor laundry area into our ground floor foyer/garage area. Did I mention the ankle deep river with a current that was our upstairs hallway?!? I probably should reference that... Even with the almost immediate shut off of all water to the house, the impact was significant.  All in all: about $14000 worth of damages to the home.<br />LG customer service has been horrific. They continued to reference the event as a &#34;leak&#34; despite my repeated efforts to semantically clarify the incident. LG has taken the stance that as the unit was out of warranty, they &#34;can not be responsuble&#34; for its malfunction or ensuing damages. They have refused to pay for/ assist with our homeowners deductible  &  even charged me over $200 for a &#34;service visit&#34; for repairs to the machine wherein I was told there appeared to be nothing wrong with the unit. Moreover, I &#34;shouldn't worry&#34; about using it in the future. He changed an overflow valve Anyway even though it did not appear to be damaged. Oookkkkaayyy. I feel super confident now with my sparkly front load LG tsunami maker because DUH, I Shouldn't Worry, right?!? Besides, LG stands by the &#34;repair&#34; for 90 days.<br /><br />So YES, if you like living dangerously & want a major appliance within your household to be manufactured  by a company that behaves in a manner consistent with a sociopath, then splurge & get this LG Washing Machine.",8/14/15,POSITIVE

So the fact at the time of writing this review the price is at 394.51 with free shipping is INSANE! So if the price doesn't drop go buy a Sonya at http://amzn.to/1HM4D2V in retrospect I think they got a larger capacity in the Sonya.<br /><br />FIRST CONTACT: This arrived is perfect shape, no dents, no nothing. At first it did make a slightly weird sound, but it resolved itself right away (maybe the belt was slightly off?) Anyway it heats up very well, but ventilation is kind of tricky (if your not very hands on). The back vent is just a circle extruded out, and it comes with the oval shaped exhaust vent which I personally found to be 100% useless.<br /><br />THE EXHAUST: The circular exhaust doesn't stick out much so it was kind of difficult for me to zip tie a hose to it, but I managed to do it, and it works great. You must find some way to expel the exhaust otherwise the dryer will suck the moisture back in from the front intake vent, and yeah your cloths will never dry this way.<br /><br />BUTTON LOCATIONS: Okay so this is kind of annoying, but I guess its whatever. The heat knob is located in the bottom right which means you need to pretty much be on the floor when turning the dial. The button to the left of this the one you press allows you to switch from automatic heat or timed heat. Personally timed heat I think works best, but the auto is good to save energy since the unit has a built in moisture sensor you just turn the dial knob all the way up to 200 minutes with the button depressed, and it will start auto drying.<br /><br />CAPACITY: I would say it has plenty. If your doing blankets you got to do one at a time if they are king size since they will pretty much take up the whole dryer.<br /><br />LINT FILTER: The filter is located in center of the drum you just reach in and pull is straight towards you and it will pop out. It will feel like your going to great it, but trust me you won't. When they say clean the filter they mean clean the dang filter. If you don't keep up with the filter you will be 100% disappointed with this dryer. If you clean it before every load, or after every load than you will be a happy camper.<br /><br />SHIPPING: When the FedEx guy came to the front, and slammed it down (not literally, but it was a light drop). I was concerned about how it would perform after some rough shipping. It preformed great, and was packaged well (I thought it was anyway).<br /><br />Quality of drying a normal load: Simply put it dryers 1-2 loads of very well, but keep up with the filter, and make sure it is proper ventilated.<br /><br />REASON FOR 4 STARS: Button location - Okay so if you got this on the Avanti stand that allows you to have it up in the air than the button location probably is not a problem, and the fact that they are on the bottom would be of benefit.

It died on Tuesday and I had this one delivered to my front door Thursday morning. The one I had, the dryer stopped working right after a year. Some things you can fix yourself - it's not that complex of a washer/dryer, but after emailing back and forth with the seller we realized it wasn't something simple. I hardly just wanted to toss the unit so I kept using the washer part for several years and I would just ring out my clothes. It was a pretty good little washer. But Tuesday I had run it for hours, there was a lot of laundry. I finally finished my last load and the machine was off. I was sitting in the living room when I heard a funny noise in the kitchen. I got up to go see what it was and walked in just in time to see sparks shoot out the back. In the outlet I just had plugged in the washer/dryer and microwave. Neither one were running at the time. I quickly pulled both cords out and it blew that breaker. Smoke was coming from my machine. Luckily it's so lightweight I could easily drag it outside. Even after it sat out there for an hour, the machine still had a kind of burning electrical smell. I carried it out to the dumpster and that was that.<br /><br />I got on Amazon and started shopping and even after all that, I still love this style of washer/dryer. Many people have them and if my experience was indicative of this machine, there would be more people talking about it. It could happen with any appliance - and I did work this washer hard on a regular basis. It gave me a lot of good use and I enjoyed having it. When I found this listing, I knew it was the one. The seller got it here super-fast and I got to test this one out last night. While it looks the same, it ran different but better. The agitation is much stronger. I put the same amount of soap in the first load but the suds went all crazy. It was full of suds. I had to scoop them out then run it again after filling only with cold water. I'll use about 1/4 of the detergent in this one than what I used in the old one. I also lifted up the lid while it was washing and holy heck, it really was moving everything around a lot. They may have improved upon this washer in the last few years. I also tested out the dryer. On my old one, it seemed that plastic insert thing would frequently get off balanced (when it was still working). I was almost afraid to test it, to ruin the &#34;magic&#34; because I was so happy about having a washer. Upon testing it, it stayed balanced and squeezed all the moisture out. So far, I'm pretty thrilled!<br /><br />Update: I just wanted to come back real quick to say I'm still loving this washer/dryer combo! My clothes are much cleaner. Also, I noticed there is this lip going around the top of the spin/dry barrel I hadn't seen in my last unit. It makes it less likely the plastic insert would come out by accident.

So far, I'm pretty thrilled!<br /><br />Update: I just wanted to come back real quick to say I'm still loving this washer/dryer combo! My clothes are much cleaner. Also, I noticed there is this lip going around the top of the spin/dry barrel I hadn't seen in my last unit. It makes it less likely the plastic insert would come out by accident. I feel convinced now they did make improvements over the years.",8/14/15,POSITIVE

I read great reviews but am disappointed after using the machine. It's just too much work for washing 2 or 3 pieces of clothing at a time. The washing cycle is max 15 mins long which isn't enough sometimes. And there are so many soap suds in the clothes after draining a washing cycle, that I either have to take out the clothes and rinse them in the sink by hand before putting them in the spin dryer, or I have to repeat the washing cycle 2 or 3 times after draining the first cycle to rinse all the soap out of the clothes. And then the clothes have to transferred out of the washing bin into the spinning bin. And then after spinning they have to be hung up to dry or put in a separate dryer machine. A narrow undetachable u-shaped hook is fit on the draining pipe which adds an unnecessary kink to it and slows it's drainage. Plus the hook is so narrow it won't fit over my bathtub, bathroom sink or kitchen sink. When I turn on the drain, the water gushes out the drain pipe so fast that the drain pipe will jump out of the bathtub and onto the floor (making an awful mess) unless I place something heavy on the drain pipe to keep it in place. Overall too much hassle. I still use it to wash small items that I don't want to mix with a load of laundry, like a new shirt that may wash out a lot of color, or when i need to wash one item without waiting to gather a load. But otherwise I have gone back to gathering loads of laundry over weeks and hauling it to the public machines.",8/13/15,NEGATIVE

(3) Then the &#34;low-washer&#34; feature seems to be a joke, as it should be called, &#34;not enough water&#34;.  It takes FOREVER tomplete a wash cycle.  Often, the dark clothes have white marks from the detergent, the clothes are not clean, and they really don't smell clean at all.

I'm wondering if this might work, even though it sounds like a pain to do.  The Whirlpool guide specifically says to NOT add additional water to the tub, but I'm wondering if that actually might work.<br />Has anyone found a way to make this machine actually work, as I can't afford to just throw it away and get a new machine.  At this point, I'm definitely NOT a Whirlpool fan.",8/13/15,NEGATIVE

You will need to get used to a new way of doing laundry, but once you learn all the functions, and how the washer works, (leave it alone, it knows what its doing..) you are going to be happy you made this choice like I was.  I will suggest to buy the warranty on the washer even if you are not a warranty person.  Skip the warranty on the dryer, it is an uncomplicated appliance but the washer needs a warranty as far more complicated to repair and more expensive. Has lovely tones that go off when your load is starting a new function and when the load is done. Washer lid locks when the load starts, but easy to pause and it will click open if you need to add something you forgot.  I prefer to use laundry pac soaps dropped directly in the tub as keeps the washer cleaner, but you can use liquids and powders as well in special drawer type cups. Also has a cup for bleach.  LOVE the &quot;bedding&quot; selection for blankets, sheets, even pillows.  The nice big stainless tub is gorgeous!  I know, I know, it's just a washer, but I am so proud of this washer!",8/13/15,POSITIVE

Well not little, it was actually quite big, which was great because I thought it would hold a lot less clothing. Very light and easy to operate. I washed 4 loads right out the box and the spinner was amazing. It pretty much dried out my clothes. DO NOT expect this to heat dry your clothes. Its a spin dryer like the spin cycle on a regular washer. Noise is not bad, It does make some so don't expect it to be silent. Make sure the hose is up and on normal when you are filling it or it would spill out (Learned that the hard way.) Also the hose does not fit my sink. I did not have a problem with that because I just filled it with a bucket as in my opinion, it would take forever with the hose. I also wash in my bathtub because when draining, the hose needs to be leveled and is on the bottom. If anything, that would be the only issue I have with this washer. The hose should've been on top for easy draining. Little bit of soap goes a long way. I washed shirts, socks, undies, hand towels and wash cloths. Tonight I will try jeans and towels and see how that works. Clothes do get tangled so get a mesh bag to prevent it. Overall, This machine gets 5 stars. I wanted to get a Panda, since it seems to be the top of the line twin tub washer but I couldn't afford 200+shipping. I'm hoping this lasts a while. I will check in with another update soon via video so people can see how this beauty works! If you know what to expect using these, I suggest this. If you don't know much about these machines, please YouTube it before buying. Some people expect too much but this is EXACTLY what I expected and I'm satisfied.",8/13/15,POSITIVE

Simplicity At Its Finest,"This refrigerator does not have a water dispenser in the door, or an icemaker in the freezer, or multiple doors to access your food. It's a solid, basic, ergonomically-correct refrigerator that's quiet, keeps our food cold, and looks great in stainless steel. Plus I love the 18 cu ft size because it's roomy inside but does not overpower the kitchen. A simple digital display inside the fridge shows the temp setting for both the fridge and the freezer, with easy up-down arrows to change (4 is recommended). The fridge itself has everything at eye level for easy finding and reach. The bottom freezer pulls straight out like a big smooth drawer for easy access to a top and bottom wire rack. Personally I removed the plastic dividers inside the freezer racks to accommodate/make more room for odd-shaped stuff. Just a great fridge.  Remember when kitchen appliances were quality-made and lasted for years? Ah the last of a dying breed, get it while you can. By the way Amana is owned by Whirlpool.",8/12/15,POSITIVE

After a few months I noticed water pooling in the refrigerator. After three trips from service it was determined it was a design flaw on a small sheet metal guide that was supposed to help funnel water into the evaporation pan. It was replaced and all was fine for a time. Now the refrigerator is freezing up and consequently can not cool. 50 degrees is not a safe operating temperature for a refrigerator. I called the same repair place but they are so busy repairing new Samsung appliances that are still under warranty they will not even take work that is not under warrantee. Samsung customer service, after keeping me on line for 25 minutes, suggested I call someone to come fix what ever was wrong with it. I never got the list of approved vendors. Poorly designed and engineered.   All shelving is fairly flimsy plastic. After just two years I am faced with buying another new refrigerator. It won't be a Samsung.",8/12/15,NEGATIVE

This problem is made much more annoying by the fact that it's constantly getting itself turned on when you brush against it and then when you accidentally activate the start button (also easy to do by brushing against it) it stubbornly refuses to let you cancel whatever random settings (also easy to set by brushing against it) it had at the moment you accidentally started it. I've tried turning it off, pulling the plug out, but nothing works. Didn't they test this design in actual day-to-day use and notice this design problem??? All these settings and on/off buttons are right on the top where you would expect to brush against them all the time. And this problem happens all the time. Right now I have a load accidentally running on delicate setting. I'm just hoping I don't have to run it all through again as, even on auto setting it's been known not to clean thoroughly. Often I have a mostly empty dishwasher that I'm not ready to start but is determined to go on.<br /><br />Design suggestion for Bosch, make it so the touch sensitive buttons are recessed. Or at least make the start button impossible to activate accidentally.<br /><br />If there is some secret button press combination that lets you undo settings once it's started, I'd love to know what it is. I wasn't able to spot it in the manual.<br /><br />Also, the crazily complex instructions for what specific cutlery type is supposed to go where in the upright cutlery rack are a joke (there are about 80 slots all labeled; are you supposed to keep the guide handy at all times or learn them by heart?).
